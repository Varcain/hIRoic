STM32 Microcontroller based Impulse Response loader hobby project

Semi-abandoned hobby project implementing Impulse Response DSP on STM32 MCU.
Mainly for guitar cabinet simulation - useful when prototyping breadboard guitar amplifiers
at home.

Using FreeRTOS, uGFX for GUI and Qt program for GUI prototyping over serial port.

At time of code push using:
STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.7.0
ugfx_2.5
